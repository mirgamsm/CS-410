Course Project 

AcceleratED Learning LLC is dedicated to bringing students across America up to their
reading level. They will maintain a database of highly-qualified educators who are
interested in working closely with school districts to help to close the education
gap. A team of CCSU students created a web application that allows educators to
create and manage a profile with AcceleratED Learning. The company owner will use
this site to view and organize profiles and to get in contact with educators.
